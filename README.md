## <a href="https://github.com/ash-ashutosh/SQL_Projects/tree/main/Credit%20Card%20Project">Credit Card Data Set Project</a>
- Identify cities with the highest credit card spending to focus on promotions or tailored campaigns.
- Ensure the business is prepared for higher transaction volumes during those months.
- Designing card-specific offers or rewards for customers nearing or exceeding high spend thresholds.

## Skills Demonstrated
### 1. Data Aggregation & Summarization
- Demonstrated ability to aggregate data by calculating sums, averages, or other metrics, such as total spends, highest expenses, and rankings.
- Used SUM(), GROUP BY, and PARTITION BY to handle complex aggregation across different dimensions.
### 2. Window Functions
- Used window functions like SUM() OVER, RANK() OVER, ROW_NUMBER() OVER, LEAD() OVER, LAG() OVER etc.
### 3. Conditional Logic & Filtering
- Employed WHERE clauses, conditional checks, and comparisons to filter data based on specific business rules
- Used case statements and JOIN to filter or segregate the data to meet the business objectives.
### 4. Time-based Calculations
- Demonstrated knowledge in handling time-based data by calculating month-over-month growth, identifying peaks, or calculating the duration to reach certain milestones, like the 500th transaction.
- Applied DATEPART(), DATEDIFF(), and EXTRACT(), FORMAT(), DATENAME() to work with dates efficiently.
### 5. Data Ranking & Comparison
- Demonstrated expertise in ranking and comparing data using RANK() and ROW_NUMBER(), DENSE_RANK() functions to determine top results, such as highest spends, city performance, or growth patterns.
### 6. Complex Join Operations
- Used INNER JOIN and multiple CTEs (Common Table Expressions) to merge datasets and perform multi-step calculations across various datasets.
### 7. Performance Optimization
- Optimized queries to filter and rank the data in a way that allows for efficient processing (e.g., limiting the result set with TOP or WHERE clauses, ensuring only necessary rows are returned).
### 8. Data Quality & Consistency
- Ensured accurate and consistent results by properly partitioning the data and maintaining integrity through GROUP BY, PARTITION BY, and appropriate filtering techniques.
